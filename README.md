## Hi there 👋
My name is Tino, and I'm a Software Engineering Bootcamp graduate with a passion for Python and Data Analysis! 

 ⁠🔭 I’m currently working on building my first-ever Portfolio Website using fastHTML, where I'll showcase my projects and achievements. 

 ⁠🌱 I’m currently learning and refining my skills in:

  •⁠  ⁠ Pandas for data manipulation 
    
  •⁠  ⁠ Scikit-learn for machine learning
    
  •⁠  ⁠ Matplotlib for data visualisation 
    
  •⁠  ⁠ Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis

Feel free to explore my repos and see what I'm up to! 😊
